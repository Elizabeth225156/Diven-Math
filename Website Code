<h1>Diven Math</h1>

<h2>Area of Concern</h2>
<p>Around the world, there are many different cases where some individuals are well educated and some aren’t in the way they are supposed to. There are many children that can’t get access to perfectly good education and it is known that those that do have access typically hate the curriculum. With using what we know, for us it is necessary to improve the way math is taught. Our goal is to create an app for young users to practice their math knowledge and also educate them in a way where it will help those <b>drastically</b>. This includes students anywhere from elementary school math to pre-algebra which is mostly found to be learned in high-school.</p>
